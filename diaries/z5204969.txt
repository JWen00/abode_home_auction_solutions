## Week 1

- Group formed. I created the group on the COMP3900 WebCMS3. After our first lab as a team, we decided on the project for our group (OnlinePropertySales Project). Together we decided a date for our regular weekly meetings outside of labs, and resolved to bring ideas for potential API integrations to discuss in the upcoming meeting.

## Week 2

- Researched potential API integrations that could be used → GoogleMaps geoservicing API
- Delegated tasks for the proposal. I volunteered to research competitor's products, and write the Problem Domain, Features and Purpose part of our proposal. After some research, I selected 3 websites to be analysed and together with Teresa, started documenting and comparing different features

## Week 3

- Finalised work on the proposal. With feedback from Jen, I cleaned up the Problem Domain part of the proposal. I also took the user stories written by Annisa, and helped put them into jira, sorting them by Epics and creating basic dev tasks under each user story ticket

## Week 4

- Worked on the View a Listing story, starting to create the static page
- Dedicated time to learning the stack → storybook, Mobx, Material-UI, Typescript and React

## Week 5

- Finished the View Listing page, separating the feature, nearby facilities, and suburb profile accordions into separate components. Also abstracted the seller profile, map and auction details into individual components. Wired up the page to auction pages and search pages.
