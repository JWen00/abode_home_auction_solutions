### Problem Domain
__“To develop a website that facilitates auctions for selling properties online”__

Our system is intuitive for users to be able to search for listings with appropriate
granularity, and provide ways for users to gain insight into property details and
surrounding features. It also allow users to seamlessly list and auction
properties, providing customers with an intuitive solution for selling their properties,
instead of having to liaise with agents.
