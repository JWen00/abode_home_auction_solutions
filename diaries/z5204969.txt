## Week 1

- Group formed. I created the group on the COMP3900 WebCMS3. After our first lab as a team, we decided on the project for our group (OnlinePropertySales Project). Together we decided a date for our regular weekly meetings outside of labs, and resolved to bring ideas for potential API integrations to discuss in the upcoming meeting.

## Week 2

- Researched potential API integrations that could be used → GoogleMaps geoservicing API
- Delegated tasks for the proposal. I volunteered to research competitor's products, and write the Problem Domain, Features and Purpose part of our proposal. After some research, I selected 3 websites to be analysed and together with Teresa, started documenting and comparing different features

## Week 3

- Finalised work on the proposal. With feedback from Jen, I cleaned up the Problem Domain part of the proposal. I also took the user stories written by Annisa, and helped put them into jira, sorting them by Epics and creating basic dev tasks under each user story ticket

## Week 4

- Worked on the View a Listing story, starting to create the static page
- Dedicated time to learning the stack → storybook, Mobx, Material-UI, Typescript and React

## Week 5

- Finished the View Listing page, separating the feature, nearby facilities, and suburb profile accordions into separate components. Also abstracted the seller profile, map and auction details into individual components. Wired up the page to auction pages and search pages.

## Week 6

- Worked on the filters for search listing. Refactored code and changed some of the date selector components to have consistent UI across pages.

# Week 7
- Worked on the profile functionality. Added basic structure for the profile page and tab components. Implemented the My Bids, Starred Properties and My Listings tabs on the profile with Teresa

# Week 8
- Worked on the profile modal on the view listing page that included information about the seller including avatar, name and blurb as well as all of the user's listings.

# Week 9
- Worked with Eddie on the HTML templates for email notifications for notifying users about auctions starting, auctions ending, buyers that won an auction, buyers that were unsuccessful at an auction, sellers that sold their property, sellers that had a property pass in at auction.
- Also worked on UI component to include closed auctions for search filters
