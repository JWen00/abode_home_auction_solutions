* Week 6 - Worked on Add Listing Pages & Form vaidation 
* Week 7 - Worked on Profile Dashboard Pages  
* Week 8 - Worked on Profile Detail Form, Avatar, Edit Blurb
         - I was stuck on images here and didn't finish my part for the 3rd sprint 
         - This was because i was unfamiliar with the file types, particularlly for the backend and did not know it had to change into an arraybuffer. 
         - My teammates were also stumped with this and so we were not able demo this in the second demo 
* Week 9 - Worked on Editing Profile & Revamps on Profile form 
         - Teresa had figured out the step of changing File -> arrayBuffer shortly after the 4th sprint started 
* Week 10 - Writing Comments/Testing Fixes 
          - Bug fixing  

Overall, I was consistently working on the project and felt our team communication get better as each sprint passed.
